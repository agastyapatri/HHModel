#   **Simulating the Hodgkin Huxley Neuron**

```
Functionalities Structure:

HHModel:
    main.py - testing the simulator code; must be identical to how the UX is intended. 
    models - directory containing all the spiking neuron models; need to have an identical API which exposes identical functionality. 
    solver directory - containing all the resources used to solve the HHmodel given a configuration space. The solver must comfortably operate upon any model that is given to it. 
    utilities/
        file io - outputting text files to use as raw data for machine learning. 
        imaging - Visualiziation utilities for the solver output 

```
